### Description
This tomb is classified as a rock cut chamber based on how it was constructed. It contained mainly **inhumation** burials. In alcove-like areas lead and wood coffins were discovered along with **sarcophagi**. Next to the burials were **grave goods** such as coins, glass vessels, jewelry, and pottery that were discovered. As a result the tomb can be dated back to around 76- 400 CE, the Roman Imperial period.
