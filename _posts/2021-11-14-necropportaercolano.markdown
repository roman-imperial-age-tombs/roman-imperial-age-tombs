### Description
This necropolis is situated at the Porta Ercolano gate near the VI region of Pompeii. This is the largest necropolis discovered in Pompeii. It contains tombs, urns, and burials. The larger tombs house cremated bodies placed in urns. Many burials were marked with a human bust which was common way to mark resting places. Among the most common types of tombs were those with an **aedicula**, **exedra**, and those surrounded by a wall or fence. On the less common side there are some tombs that are designed to look like temple altars by being made in marble and built on a podium with statues on the sides.
