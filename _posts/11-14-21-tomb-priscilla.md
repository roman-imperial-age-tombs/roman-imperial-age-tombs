This tomb was erected in the first century CE in Rome right off the **Via Appia**. The tomb was made for Priscilla, wife of Titus Flavius Abascanto, a freedman of the Emperor Domitian. The base is made of **travertine** blocks and has a cylindrical tower built on top of it. The tower had 13 **niches** to hold statues of the dead.
