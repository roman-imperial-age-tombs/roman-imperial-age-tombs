### Description
This necropolis is on the north coast of the Grove peninsula, and it represents the remains of a Roman Village. There is a combination of Roman-style burials and Germanic-style burials. These burials were found around the Germanic-style church, and spanned over many years because of the overlapping style the remains were found in. Many were simple graves with stone markers, but there were also a couple **Sarcophagi**.
