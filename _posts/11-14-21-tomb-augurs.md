### Description
This is an Etruscan burial chamber, and was named the Tomb of the Augurs because the figure on the right wall was observed as a Roman priest which is known as an **augur**. The walls were painted sometime between 530-520 BCE by an Ionian Greek painter. This tomb also displays depictions of funerary rites and rituals instead of mythology. The chamber was decorated with a figurative on all four walls. This **fresco** consisted of plants and animals.
