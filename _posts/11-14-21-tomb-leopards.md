### Description
This is an Etruscan burial chamber in Tarquinia, and has one of the best-preserved murals in Tarquinia. It is named the Tomb of the Leopards because of the two leopards painted above the banquet scene on the back wall. It dates back to around 480-450 BCE. This tomb was painted with people, plants, and animals on all four walls. The mural draws your attention to the main piece, which is the back wall, and the ceiling. It was painted very elaborately and with many bright colors that have stayed vivid and have been well-preserved over the years.
