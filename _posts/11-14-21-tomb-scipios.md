### Description
The monument has two sections: the main complex and a brick-built arcade with a separate entrance. The central room is separated by four pilasters, with four long arcades along two central galleries. A high podium is the base of the structure, and it had three ashlar arches. One arch lead to the main tomb, another to a room, and the third on lead to no where. The upper part had semicolumns and three **niches** where statues of **Scipio Africanus**, **Scipio Asiaticus**, and the poet **Ennius** were placed.
