### Description
This Roman necropolis followed the Roman custom and was built outside the city along the main roads (Via Emona and Via Celeia). Some graves that were uncovered have **aediculae** with sculptures and reliefs. Some of these reliefs depicted myths of resurrection, which was a popular design for funerary monuments along with depictions of dead and underworld.
