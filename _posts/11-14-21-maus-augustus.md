### Description
This **mausoleum** was built in 28 BCE on the **Campus Martius**. It is a circular plan with concentric rings and had a conical roof and a bronze statue of Augustus. Two granite obelisks were on either side of the arched entrance, and a corridor from there went straight into the mausoleum. In the chamber there were three **niches** to house the golden **urns** of the Imperial Family.
