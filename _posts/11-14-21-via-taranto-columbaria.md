### Description
This site consists of two separate columbariums. Columbarium 1 housed a small number of burials and the sides had two templed **aedicules** with urns. The walls were decorated with depictions of ribbons, garlands, and geometric squares. One panel had the goddess **Fortuna** painted on it as well as other decorations of pomegranates and grapes. Columbarium 2 had about 10 **niches** filled with urns, and three burials were also discovered here.
