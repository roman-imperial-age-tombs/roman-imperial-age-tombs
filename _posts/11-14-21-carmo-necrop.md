### Description
High-ranking citizens in Carmo were able to construct grand tombs just outside the city along the main roads. The Roman necropolis consisted of ancient **Tartessian** funerary monuments and Roman tombs. The unique trait about these tombs was that the bodies were buried in a bent position with their heads facing westward. There were a couple large tombs: 'Tomb of the ELephant' and 'Tomb of Servilia', which is the most monumental tomb here.


## Tombs
#### Tomb of Servilia
It was built to resemble a complete Roman Villa. It even had a courtyard surrounded by porticos with colonnaded arches, and the arches contained statues. This tomb had areas for burials, and a columbarium for urns. The walls were painted in **fresco** or **distemper** in a **Pompeian-style**.
