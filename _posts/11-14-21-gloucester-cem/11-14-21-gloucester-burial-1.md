### Description
In the Gloucester area there are several small cemeteries with signs of **Romanization**. Many are burials and some are in a stone **sarcophagus**. There are still some **cremations**, but as the Romans later turned to **inhumation** burials, so did the regions they occupied. Even some burials are found in a wood coffin and buried outside the town along a major road. This is obeys the Roman laws on funeral customs/rites. Therefore showing evidence of Roman burials or burial styles from the Romans that have been used here as well.
