### Description
At this necropolis only four tombs were found. The most famous on was the Tomb of Caius Vestorius Priscus which is dated back to 75-76 AD. A semi-circular bench schaped tomb was dedicated to Arellia Tertulla, and near it was a funerary column for another woman of the name Septumia. The last tomb discovered in this small necropolis was dedicated to Marcus Veius Marcellus.
