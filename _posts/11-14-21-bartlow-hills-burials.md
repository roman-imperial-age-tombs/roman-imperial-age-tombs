### Description
The burials here were mostly **cremations** rather than **inhumation**. It also has some of the best preserved Roman **barrows** in England. There are a total of six Roman barrows, and four of them remain preserved as steep conical mounds. The other two barrows have been leveled. Many glass cinerary urns were found in these mounds along with grave goods like gold rings, coins, glass containers filled with liquids, bowls, lamps, and pottery.
